# An-Icon-A-Day
An Illustrator vector icon, every day, for a year

What is this? A github repository of icons, started January 27th 2015. Come this time next year, there will hopefully be (at least) 365 icons here.

Why? Well, in my day-job (digital designer) I use basic icons all the time - such as icons for play, wifi, cloud, various arrows, etc. Up until now, I've mostly used stock icons from other sources, but in order to brush up my Illustrator skills a bit (I primarily use Axure RP and Photoshop), as well as get more familiar with Github, I've set myself the task to make a new icon every day for a year.
